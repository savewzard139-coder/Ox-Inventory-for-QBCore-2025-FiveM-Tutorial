⚠️ Notice
This version of ox_inventory has been modified to ensure broad framework compatibility, now working seamlessly with qb-core, qbox, esx, ox_core, and nd_core.

It began as a continuation of an older fork that reintroduced QB support but is no longer available. Since then, this fork has grown into a community-focused project that prioritizes compatibility while introducing small, non-intrusive quality-of-life improvements.

Important: The original ox_inventory was created by the Overextended team and remains under its original license. It is no longer actively maintained by them, and this fork is not officially supported by Overextended. Please do not contact them for issues related to this version.

Purpose
The goal of this fork is to provide a collaborative, framework-inclusive solution for the FiveM community. We believe in open-source software that adapts with community input, encouraging innovation and evolution through collective development.

Key Differences from Other Forks
Framework Compatibility
Full support for qb-core (latest versions).
Preserves complete functionality for esx, ox_core, qbox, and nd_core.
No framework-specific features are lost — everything continues to work across supported frameworks.
Rarity Indicators (Optional Visual Feature)
Rarity System Demo


Items can now display a star icon in the bottom-left corner based on a "rarity" metadata key.
Color-Based Rarities: common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, artifact, red, pink, gold, rainbow, silver, bronze, copper, blue, green, cyan, magenta, yellow, orange, purple, lime, teal, indigo, violet, maroon, navy, olive, aqua, fuchsia, black, white, crimson, turquoise, lavender, rose
The rainbow rarity features a special animated color-cycling effect.
Default Rarity Support: define rarities directly in data/items.lua or data/weapons.lua for automatic application.
Can also be overridden at runtime when adding items.
Usage Examples:
-- In data/items.lua
['rare_gem'] = {
    label = 'Rare Gem',
    weight = 50,
    rarity = 'rare',  -- Will automatically show blue star
}

-- In data/weapons.lua (inside Weapons table)
['WEAPON_LEGENDARY_PISTOL'] = {
    label = 'Legendary Pistol',
    weight = 1200,
    durability = 0.2,
    ammoname = 'ammo-9',
    rarity = 'legendary',  -- Will automatically show orange star
}

-- Runtime metadata override
exports.ox_inventory:AddItem(playerId, 'item_name', 1, {
    rarity = 'epic'  -- Overrides default rarity or sets one
})
Additional Enhancements
Extra image formats supported: .jpg, .jpeg, .gif.
More hosting sources allowed, including img.bb and Discord CDN.
These additions simplify image use for icons and embedded content without extra setup.
